# Samples for Azure Digital Twins documentation

Azure Digital Twins is a developer platform for next-generation IoT solutions that lets you create, run, and manage digital representations of your business environment, securely and efficiently in the cloud. With Azure Digital Twins, creating live operational state representations is quick and cost-effective, and digital representations stay current with real-time data from IoT and other data sources.

For more information about Azure Digital Twins and its key concepts, see the [Azure Digital Twins documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/).

## Purpose

This is a building scenario sample written in .NET that can be used to set up and simulate a full end-to-end scenario with Azure Digital Twins.

## Prerequisites

These samples were developed and expected to run in Visual Studio 2019. Ensure you have installed Visual Studio 2019 version **16.5.1XXX or later** on your development machine. If you have an older version installed already, you can open the Visual Studio Installer app on your machine and follow the prompts to update your installation.

## Setup

Get the sample project you'll use by downloading this repository as a ZIP file to your machine.

### Deploy the sample resources using ARM templates

## Sample project contents

This sample contains two code projects that can be used to set up and simulate a full end-to-end scenario that makes use of Azure Digital Twins.

The scenario components and data flow reflect this diagram:

The sample repo contains:

| File/folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AdtSampleApp` | Contains a sample client application built to interact with Azure Digital Twins, as well as an Azure Functions app with two functions (*ProcessDTRoutedData* and *ProcessHubToDTEvents*) that are used to route data between Azure Digital Twins and other external services. |
| `DeviceSimulator` | Simulator for a that generates telemetry events. The simulated device is a thermostat that sends temperature telemetry every ~5 seconds. |

## Instructions

There are two possible sets of instructions for working with this sample. Both are part of the [Azure Digital Twins documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/).
